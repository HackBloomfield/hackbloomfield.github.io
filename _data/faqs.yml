- question: What do you do at a hackathon?
  answer: Glad you asked! generally, you come to a hackathon with an idea for something you want to build (but it's also cool if you don't have an idea). then, you get together with your team (buddy up with friends!), and over the course of 24 hours, work on making that idea into something real! at the end of the hackathon you get to show off your project and potentially win prizes
- question: Hacking??? But isn't that bad???
  answer: This isn't "hacking" in the malicious sense (you're not trying to manipulate an election or anything). In this context, hacking means building something awesome in a short period of time, and having a good time building it.
- question: But i can't even code?
  answer: And that's perfectly ok! in fact, hackathons are a great place to start learning to code. We'll have mentors who program regularly present at the hackathon, and they'll help you write your first ever program! There will also be beginner workshops for Python, Arduino, Android development and more. It may seem scary if you've never programmed before, but by the end of 24 hours you'll have a solid foundation of skills to work with.
- question: Is there a code of conduct?
  answer: There is! We'll be following the MLH Code of Conduct, which can be found <a href="https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf">here</a>.
- question: 24 hours? Will we be getting any sleep?
  answer: We'll be setting aside a classroom specifically for sleeping. Although you'll probably be busy hacking away at your project, we strongly encourage you to get some sleep. Bring a sleeping bag!
- question: How much does this cost?
  answer: HackBloomfield is 100% FREE! Both the event and all meals, as well as lots of swag will be at no charge whatsoever, courtesy of our sponsors.
- question: How many people can be on a team?
  answer: There's no strict limit, but try to keep your team to no more than 4 people.
- question: Will there be prizes?
  answer: Yup! There will be both general (1st, 2nd, 3rd) and category prizes (such as best hardware hack, best android hack, etc). and of course, you all get the prize of a good time ðŸ˜›
