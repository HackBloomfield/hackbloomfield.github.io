question: but i can't even code?
answer: and that's perfectly ok! in fact, hackathons are a great place to start learning to code. we'll have mentors who program regularly present at the hackathon, and they'll help you write your first ever program! there will also be beginner workshops for python, arduino, android development and more. it may seem scary if you've never programmed before, but by the end of 24 hours you'll have a solid foundation of skills to work with
