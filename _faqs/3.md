question: but i can't even code?
answer: and that's perfectly ok! in fact, hackathons are a great place to start learning programming. we'll have mentors who program every day present at the hackathon, and they can help you write your first ever line of code! additionally, there will be beginner workshops for python, arduino, android development and more. it may seem scary if you've never programmed before, but by the end of 24 hours you'll have a solid foundation of skills to work with
