question: what do you do at a hackathon?
answer: glad you asked! generally, you come to a hackathon with an idea for something you want to build (but it's also cool if you don't have an idea). then, you get together with your team (buddy up with friends!), and over the course of 24 hours, work on making that idea into something real! at the end of the hackathon you get to show off your project and potentially win prizes!
